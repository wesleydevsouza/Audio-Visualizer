# 🎧 Audio Visualizer (P5.js)

A **visual audio-responsive** project built with **P5.js**, created for learning and experimentation with interactive media and generative visuals.

This visualizer reacts to music in real time using **particles** and a **dynamic background** that responds to audio frequency and amplitude.

### 🧪 Project Highlights:

* Real-time audio analysis with visual feedback
* Particle system synced to music
* Dynamic, randomized background on each page reload
* Customizable assets (music and background images)

### 🎛️ How to Customize:

To change the background image and music:

1. Import your desired image and audio files into the project folder
2. Edit the filenames (e.g., `Music.mp3`) in the loading section of `Sketch.js`
3. Each time the page reloads, a random image and track are selected from your assets

> 🎓 This project was made for educational purposes and experimentation with **P5.js** audio and visual libraries.
